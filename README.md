# Libraray-Management-System
This project is made to handle and manage a library where members 
could borrow, reserve, and search for books in an efficient way.

The database stores information about each book, including title, 
author/s, category, publisher and available copies. It also manages the 
borrowing operation by storing when a book was borrowed and when it 
was or should be returned. 

The library also applies fines for members who didnâ€™t return their books 
in time, therefore the database manages payments of these fines.
